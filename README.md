# 6CCS3PRJ Final Year Project 
## Title: Agent-based simulation of bicycle theft in London
###### Supervisor: Dr Simon Miles

# Abstract
This project aims to create an agent-based model of bicycle theft within London. More specifically, it focusses on deterring bicycle theft within the metropolitan area, by modelling bicycle
thefts it may be possible to find interventions to deter thefts of bicycles in the future. The
model aims to simulate thieves in a compelling way using agents as actors that have the ability
to learn and share knowledge with other thieves.

The goal of the project is to create a simple piece of software that could be used by
enforcement agencies with little technical knowledge.

# Prerequisites
In order to run the simulation you must first install NetLogo, the simulation was developed
in Version 6.1.1 (September 2019) and may not be backwards compatible with earlier versions
of NetLogo. To do this visit https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.1.1/ and download the
relevant application depending on your current operating system.
