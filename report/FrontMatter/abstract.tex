This project aims to create an agent-based model of bicycle theft within London. More specifically, it focusses on deterring bicycle theft within the metropolitan area, by modelling bicycle thefts it may be possible to find interventions to deter thefts of bicycles in the future. The model aims to simulate thieves in a compelling way using agents as actors that have the ability to learn and share knowledge with other thieves. \par

The goal of the project is to create a simple piece of software that could be used by enforcement agencies with little technical knowledge.
