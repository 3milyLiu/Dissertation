 abstract = {In this paper we present a "routine activity approach" for analyzing crime rate trends and cycles. Rather than emphasizing the characteristics of offenders, with this approach we concentrate upon the circumstances in which they carry out predatory criminal acts. Most criminal acts require convergence in space and time of likely offenders, suitable targets and the absence of capable guardians against crime. Human ecological theory facilitates an investigation into the way in which social structure produces this convergence, hence allowing illegal activities to feed upon the legal activities of everyday life. In particular, we hypothesize that the dispersion of activities away from households and families increases the opportunity for crime and thus generates higher crime rates. A variety of data is presented in support of the hypothesis, which helps explain crime rate trends in the United States 1947-1974 as a byproduct of changes in such variables as labor force participation and single-adult households.},

abstract = "Traditionally, researchers have employed statistical methods to model crime. However, these approaches are limited by being unable to model individual actions and behaviour. Brantingham and Brantingham (1993) described that in their opinion a useful and productive model for simulating crime would have the ability to model the occurrence of crime and the motivations behind it both temporally and spatially. This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. It presents a novel framework that allows both human and environmental factors to be simulated. Although other agent-based models of crime do exist, this research represents the first working example of integrating a behavioural framework into an ABM for the simulation of crime. An artificial city, loosely based on the real city of Leeds, UK, and an artificial population were constructed, and experiments were run to explore the potential of the model to realistically simulate the main processes and drivers within this system. The results are highly promising, demonstrating the potential of this approach for both understanding processes behind crime and improving policies and developing effective crime prevention strategies."

  abstract={
Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for
complex tasks. However, these controllers have limited memory and rely
on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each decision
point. To address these shortcomings, this article investigates the
effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing
the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recurrent
LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although
capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully
integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance
on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring
flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial
observations and evaluated with incrementally more complete
observations, DRQN's performance scales as a function of
observability. Conversely, when trained with full observations and
evaluated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less
than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a
viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input
layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learning
to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation
time if the quality of observations changes.

    abstract = {Urban authorities are continuously drawing up policies to promote cycling among commuters. However, these initiatives are counterproductive for the targeted objectives because they increase opportunities for bicycle theft. This paper explores Inner London as a case study to address place-specific risk factors for bicycle theft at the street-segment level while controlling for seasonal variation. The presence of certain public amenities (e.g., bicycle stands, railway stations, pawnshops) was evaluated against locations of bicycle theft between 2013 and 2016 and risk effects were estimated using negative binomial regression models. Results showed that a greater level of risk stemmed from land-use facilities than from area-based socioeconomic status. The presence of facilities such as train stations, vacant houses, pawnbrokers and payday lenders increased bicycle theft, but no evidence was found that linked police stations with crime levels. The findings have significant implications for urban crime prevention with respect to non-residential land use.},
